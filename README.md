I.	Introduction

The Simple Computer is a learning tool designed to aid in the understanding of how real computers operate.  The Simple Computer, abbreviated SC, is a virtual computer. SC is a virtual computer because it is software that acts as a completely separate machine from the computer is being used on.  That is, it acts as a real computer, with its own input, output, memory, and CPU. 

When a software based application, that runs on a real computer, acts as a separate virtual computer, it is called an emulator. The simple computer is an emulator because it illustrates the functions of a computer via software without any of the physical equipment normally associated with a computer.
